## What is this?

This is a collection of integer linear programs (ILP) formulated to provide solutions to a collection of decision problems. See **MATH2730 Group Project Report.pdf** to see the decision problems.

To see how and why the ILP solutions were created. I.e. rationality behind choice of variables, decision variables, objective function and constraints see **MATH2730 Group Project Report.pdf** .

##### Note
This was originally created for a  group project in a **operations research** course undertaken at university in 2018 for a group project.

### Requirements:
FICO Xpress IVE (We used version 8.4).

### Running the .mos solutions:
Load a .mos into FICO Xpress IVE and hit run model.
